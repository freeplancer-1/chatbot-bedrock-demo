# chatbot-bedrock-demo

This repository contains a minimal ReactJS chat app under `react-chat-app`. The project demonstrates common React mistakes and shows where AWS Amplify integration would go.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd react-chat-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Optional Amplify commands are described in `react-chat-app/README.md` along with explanations of the simulated errors.
